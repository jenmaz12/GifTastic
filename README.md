When the user comes to my GifTastic site, they will see twelve buttons, each with a different animal name. They will also see a form field below and to the right of the buttons where they can type in an animal and add it to the button list when they press submit.

When the user clicks a animal button, premade or one they created, ten gifs about that animal and their ratings will appear to the left of the form field.

If the user clicks on a gif, it will start to move. If they click on it again it will stop moving.
